## Risk Disclosures

The Linea Mainnet is continuously evolving through ongoing upgrades. Security is a top priority, and we aim to enhance the protections users rely on when interacting with the system. This page outlines current risks and security measures users should understand before using the Linea network.

## Potential Threats and Security Measures

As the Linea Mainnet is currently in its Alpha phase, it is still undergoing security audits and assessments. Consequently, your data and crypto-assets may be exposed to risks such as software bugs or related vulnerabilities.

Linea uses innovative, cutting-edge technology that may introduce unforeseen risks. These could potentially result in data loss or loss of crypto-assets.

Cross-chain bridge processes could be targets of cyber attacks, including exploits that take advantage of vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or infrastructure—especially components like bridges, smart contracts, and related systems.

## Network Accessibility and Efficiency

Due to the Alpha status of the Mainnet, occasional performance slowdowns or temporary outages may occur without prior notice. These could lead to unexpected loss of access, data, or crypto-assets. Users making high-value transactions should be aware that transaction finalization might be delayed.

## The Journey Toward Decentralization

The Linea team is actively working to increase decentralization and reduce trust assumptions over time.

In the Mainnet Alpha phase, centralized components such as the Sequencer, Prover, and Security Council are operated by the Linea team to support the network's initial rollout. The Sequencer can delay or reorder transactions.

Additionally, Linea’s validity proofs currently do not cover 100% of EVM opcodes and precompiles, meaning they are not fully complete. Therefore, users must place a level of trust in the Linea operator not to alter the system maliciously.

Security is an ongoing effort. The Security Council—composed of eight members—has the authority to pause the rollup or upgrade the Mainnet Alpha without submitting a validity proof, provided 75% of members sign off. This power is in place to respond to critical security threats. However, if members act maliciously or collude, it could compromise the system and lead to changes that might result in loss of assets.

The centralized nature of the Sequencer and Prover also introduces potential risks of downtime or outages, some of which may be beyond the control of the Linea team.

In the early Mainnet Beta phase, users cannot force transactions on Layer 1, and withdrawal limits exist on the bridge to mitigate potential malicious activity.

## Third-Party dApps

Like Ethereum, Linea is permissionless, allowing anyone to deploy smart contracts. Users should take the same precautions as on Ethereum—only interact with applications they trust and believe to be secure.

## Audits and Security Checks

Linea’s implementation has been carefully developed, with continuous internal and external audits by leading Web3 security firms (including Consensys Diligence), along with extensive testing and best-practice engineering. Despite this, undiscovered vulnerabilities may still exist, and users should assess the risk when deciding how much value to commit to the Mainnet Alpha.

To enhance security, Linea has launched a bug bounty program to encourage the discovery of critical issues. More information is available on the Linea Bug Bounty page on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/linea/).
